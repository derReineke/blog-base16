Welcome to my new blog! Isn't this exciting that I am *finally* starting to write in one? This is the blog section for my main portfolio page, [Main Page](https://derreineke.com/). I love that page so much and I really think you should check it out if you haven't. I followed a Brutalist Design for it.

What will this blog contain you may be asking yourself as you read this on a screen, maybe a small phone screen or even a larger monitor. This blog will be about a lot of things is my answer to you. But really I will write about whatever is on my mind at the time, which is a lot but I will try to focus on something for the post. I want to discuss technology, art, design, Philosophy, language, and anything else that I fancy.

Do I have any social media you ask yourself. Yes and no. I do not have a Facebook or Twitter account. I DO have a Mastodon, however! Ah federated social media that doesn't depress me even further, isn't it great? I will share a link at some point for that, but for now you will have to hold onto your horsies.

As a side note, if it hasn't been obvious to this point, I will be using a lighter, more informal tone on the blog. I like using a more professional tone on my main site, but I enjoy more conversational language for writing in this format. If you hate it let me know with a TootToot.
