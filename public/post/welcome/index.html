    <p>Welcome to my new blog! Isn&rsquo;t this exciting that I am <em>finally</em> starting to write in one? This is the blog section for my main portfolio page, <a href="https://derreineke.com/">Main Page</a>. I love that page so much and I really think you should check it out if you haven&rsquo;t. I followed a Brutalist Design for it.</p>

<p>What will this blog contain you may be asking yourself as you read this on a screen, maybe a small phone screen or even a larger monitor. This blog will be about a lot of things is my answer to you. But really I will write about whatever is on my mind at the time, which is a lot but I will try to focus on something for the post. I want to discuss technology, art, design, Philosophy, language, and anything else that I fancy.</p>

<p>Do I have any social media you ask yourself. Yes and no. I do not have a Facebook or Twitter account. I DO have a Mastodon, however! Ah federated social media that doesn&rsquo;t depress me even further, isn&rsquo;t it great? I will share a link at some point for that, but for now you will have to hold onto your horsies.</p>

<p>As a side note, if it hasn&rsquo;t been obvious to this point, I will be using a lighter, more informal tone on the blog. I like using a more professional tone on my main site, but I enjoy more conversational language for writing in this format. If you hate it let me know with a TootToot.</p>
